# E-T-L_Project
Extract Transform Load Group Project:

This group project is an example of how to E-T-L:

  * Extract: list original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

  * Transform: clean the extracted data and transform was required.

  * Load:  the final database contains tables/collections for follow-on analysis.
